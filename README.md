# Modifications for 3d Printed Modular Mounting System

This repo contains STL, STEP and Fustion 360 files of modifications I've made to components of the popular Modular Mount system, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278

## Mods
- Phone up/down clamp to support phones with popsockets on them. The base of the clamps were extending 6.5mm to support more depth.
